# nmap: host enumeration

Nmap works at the OSI Network layer and Transport layer. We have
to remember that each layer has its own:

* header section
* data section

We remember that the Network Layer is the one responsible for the
movement or routing of packets across the network, the protocol
used on internet at this layer is the "IP" (Internet Protocol).

The Transport layer provides the flowof data between two hosts,
for the application layer above. Examples of protocols at this
layer are:

* Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
