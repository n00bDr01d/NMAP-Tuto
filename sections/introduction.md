One of the first steps to perform when we are pentesting is
related to footprinting. In this phase what we typically do after
having gathered information about the target is performing
network scanning and enumeration. One of the most famous tool to
perform network analysis and service discovery is nmap. In this
document I will try to explain the basic concepts behind a
network mapper and the varying types of analysis that can be
performed. Although many pentesters out there are sticking to
just a single (or a couple) of nmap commands, we will find out
that depending on the situation, there may be various tunings
that can be applied. These tunings can help us in order to:

* gather more information;
* be stelthier;
* bypass firewalls;
* devise advanced analysis techniques;
